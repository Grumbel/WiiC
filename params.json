{"name":"Wiic","tagline":"A C/C++ Library to control Wiimote controllers","body":"## Intro\r\n**WiiC** is a C/C++ library to control Wii devices, such as: Wiimote, Nunchuck, Classic controller, Guitar Hero 3, Motion Plus and Balance Board.\r\nWiiC is supported on Linux and Mac platforms, and it is composed of two layers:\r\n* **WiiC** is the C layer, which extends the well known [Wiiuse library](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wiiuse/), fixing some minor bugs, porting it on Mac platforms, and adding some novel functionality, such as the Motion Plus and Balance Board support.\r\n* **WiiCpp** is the C++ layer, which is an extension of the well known library [WiiuseCpp](http://mission-cognition.houseoftechnology.org/projects/wiiusecppandpywii), and it is embedded in WiiC. The main advantage is that every novel functionality in the C layer is applied to WiiCpp as well.\r\n\r\nWiiC has been developed at [RoCoCo Laboratory](http://labrococo.dis.uniroma1.it), Sapienza University of Rome, Italy. Since RoCoCo Lab is mainly involved in mobile robotics and AI, we realized this library to control mobile robots (e.g. wheeled robots, humanoid robots, UAVs) through Wii devices. In fact, WiiC is supported by [OpenRDK](http://openrdk.sf.net) robotic framework, for a modular and agile robotic application development.","google":"UA-15174470-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
